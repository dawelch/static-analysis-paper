Emerging HPC platforms are becoming extraordinarily difficult to program as a result of complex, deep  and heterogeneous memory hierarchy, heterogeneous cores and need to divide work among them. 
Programming models and libraries being developed or enhance to relieve work of application developers but that will not be sufficient, as the application needs to apply code transformations to adapt to target architecture. To do this the programmer needs information about their source code characteristics, together with dynamic (including performance) information (and the right kind) to make key decisions.
On the other side, system administrators needs to understand how users are using the programming models and libraries in their code to exploit effectively the architecture and how this investment improves the productivity of the users on a platform.

In this paper we describe a system that we are constructing in order to provide such information at the level of an application or across multiple applications. Static and dynamically collected facts about a program that are stored and can be queried. Potentially usable by either a developer or a system-wide tool. This system is under construction yet several parts are already functional.  We show an early evaluation via a application-driven use-case studies.
