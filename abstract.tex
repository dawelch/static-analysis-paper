Emerging HPC platforms are becoming extraordinarily difficult to program as a result of complex, deep  and heterogeneous memory hierarchy, heterogeneous cores and need to divide work among them. Cost in terms of both power and performance of moving data across system.
Programming models and libraries being developed or enhance to relieve work of application developers but will not be sufficient. In many cases, developer will need to modify code
Needs information (and the right kind) to make key decisions.
In this paper we describe a system that we are constructing in order to provide such information. Static and dynamically collected facts about a program that are stored and can be queried. Potentially usable by either a developer or a tool. This system is under construction yet several parts are already functional.
