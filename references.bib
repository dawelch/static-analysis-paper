abstract="Given a program written in a simple imperative language (assignment statements,for loops, affine indices and loop limits), this paper presents an algorithm for analyzing the patterns along which values flow as the execution proceeds. For each array or scalar reference, the result is the name and iteration vector of the source statement as a function of the iteration vector of the referencing statement. The paper discusses several applications of the method: conversion of a program to a set of recurrence equations, array and scalar expansion, program verification and parallel program construction.",

abstract="This article describes how the integration of the OpenUH OpenMP compiler with the KOJAK performance analysis tool can assist developers of OpenMP and hybrid codes in optimizing their applications with as little user intervention as possible. In particular, we (i) describe how the compiler's ability to automatically instrument user code down to the flow-graph level can improve the location of performance problems and (ii) outline how the performance feedback provided by KOJAK will direct the compiler's optimization decisions in the future. To demonstrate our methodology, we present experimental results showing how reasons for the performance slow down of the ASPCG benchmark could be identified.",

computational accelerators such as NVIDIA GPUs and Intel Xeon Phi
processors is now widespread in the high performance computing community,
with many applications delivering impressive performance gains. However,
programming these systems for high performance, performance portability and
software maintainability has been a challenge. In this paper we discuss
experiences porting applications to the Titan system. Titan, which began
planning in 2009 and was deployed for general use in 2013, was the first
multi-petaflop system based on accelerator hardware. To ready applications
for accelerated computing, a preparedness effort was undertaken prior to
delivery of Titan. In this paper we report experiences and lessons learned
from this process and describe how users are currently making use of
computational accelerators on Titan.}, journal={Computers and Electrical

title="Performance portability on EARTH: a case study across several parallel architectures",
journal="Cluster Computing",
year="2007",
volume="10",
number="2",
pages="115--126",
abstract="Due to the increase of the diversity of parallel architectures, and the increasing development time for parallel applications, performance portability has become one of the major considerations when designing the next generation of parallel program execution models, APIs, and runtime system software. This paper analyzes both code portability and performance portability of parallel programs for fine-grained multi-threaded execution and architecture models. We concentrate on one particular event-driven fine-grained multi-threaded execution model---EARTH, and discuss several design considerations of the EARTH model and runtime system that contribute to the performance portability of parallel applications. We believe that these are important issues for future high end computing system software design. Four representative benchmarks were conducted on several different parallel architectures, including two clusters listed in the 23rd supercomputer TOP500 list. The results demonstrate that EARTH based programs can achieve robust performance portability across the selected hardware platforms without any code modification or tuning.",

year="2007",
volume="10",

pages="115--126",
abstract="Due to the increase of the diversity of parallel architectures, and the increasing development time for parallel applications, performance portability has become one of the major considerations when designing the next generation of parallel program execution models, APIs, and runtime system software. This paper analyzes both code portability and performance portability of parallel programs for fine-grained multi-threaded execution and architecture models. We concentrate on one particular event-driven fine-grained multi-threaded execution model---EARTH, and discuss several design considerations of the EARTH model and runtime system that contribute to the performance portability of parallel applications. We believe that these are important issues for future high end computing system software design. Four representative benchmarks were conducted on several different parallel architectures, including two clusters listed in the 23rd supercomputer TOP500 list. The results demonstrate that EARTH based programs can achieve robust performance portability across the selected hardware platforms without any code modification or tuning.",
