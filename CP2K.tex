CP2K \cite{hutter2014cp2k} is a popular molecular simulation package that includes numerous routines for quantum chemistry and solid-state physics, including ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD). Until recently, AIMD simulations on systems with thousands of atoms for timescales longer than a few picoseconds was not possible. Currently, several parallel implementations of AIMD have exploited HPC systems to achieve
