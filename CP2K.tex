CP2K \cite{hutter2014cp2k} is a popular molecular simulation package that includes numerous routines for quantum chemistry and solid-state physics, including ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) \cite{marx2009ab}. Molecular dynamics within the Born-Oppenheimer (BO) regime simulates atomic motion  according to classical mechanics, while forces may be calculated using any type of physics. For AIMD, the forces are calculated using quantum mechanics, via derivatives of the system's electronic potential energy surface. This energy is usually derived with a self-consistent field (SCF) calculation with density functional theory (DFT) \cite{vandevondele2012linear,hutter2014cp2k}, which involves an iterative solver that must converge before the energy is known, and tensor contractions of large tensors representing electron orbitals. Therefore, each time-step requires considerably more computational time and memory than classical molecular dynamics. However, AIMD is able to 

Until recently, AIMD simulations on systems with thousands of atoms for timescales longer than a few picoseconds was not possible. Currently, several parallel implementations of the DFT-based SCF calculation have exploited massive parallelization on HPC systems to obtain the SCF-based electronic energy of such large systems in under a minute \cite{vasp_bench,kresse1996efficient,cp2k_bench,vandevondele2012linear}.
